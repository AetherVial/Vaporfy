# README

Welcome to Vaporize, my personalized Spotify clone! This application makes use of RESTful API concepts, Ruby on Rails MVC framework, and the React / Redux cycle to deliver a faithful Spotify experience, but styled to my personal tastes. 

You can run this application from your personal device with the following:

Ruby v.2.5.1
Rails v.5.2.3
Node Package Manager
Postgreql

To run:
1. Start Postgreql
2. Run `npm install` in terminal
3. Run `bundle install` in terminal
4. Run `rails s` in terminal
5. Go to `localhost:3000` in browser and enjoy!
