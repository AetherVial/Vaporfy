Welcome to Vaporize, a faithful Spotify clone utilizing a Ruby on Rails, React / Redux and PostgreSQL stack. Spotify is a web app that lets users add music to their collections, create, delete, and update playlists, and follow users, playlists and artists. Vaporize aims to give users most of this functionality while demonstrating the my proficiency in the aforementioned technology stack. I hope you'll take a look around and enjoy using it!
